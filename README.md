# NYC-Transit-Times
We attempt to solve this problem in New York City, which is unsurprisingly one of the most difficult places in the world to predict ETA because of the dense population and large variation in traffic and other factors out of our control. Aside from the pick-up and drop-off locations, we also consider the day of the week and time of day when calculating the shortest ETA since these tend to be the most important factors. Ideally, we would be able to incorporate factors that other mapping services use such as speed limits, the density of traffic lights, shortest-distance routes, traffic patterns, weather, and much more, but this became infeasible for us due to the extremely high amount of complexity involved.
